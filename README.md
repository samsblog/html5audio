<strong>How it works</strong><br />
==========
Nothing special abaout here. Simply add the css-file into the head of your site, script tags are added best at the bottom of your site.<br />
head:<br />
<code>
&lang;link href='PATH/adv.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&rang;
</code>
<br />
Script:<br />
<code>
&lang;script type="text/javascript" src="PATH/jquery.x.y.js">&lang;/script>
&lang;script type="text/javascript" src="PATH/adv.min.js">&lang;/script>
</code>
<br />
Now all you have to do is to call the script on your audio-element. To do so choose a class and call per jQuery syntax:
<code>
&lang;script>
$('.yourClass').advAudio({
    color:'#c05'
});
&lang;/script>
</code>
